## Dev Setup Instructions

### Using Docker

The easiest way to get the project set up for local development is to use the [Docker setup instructions](https://github.com/LiveChurchSolutions/Docker), with the "FullStack" container.

### Manual Setup

This project depends on several APIs. You may either set them up on your local machine first, or point to the staging server copies during development. The staging server urls are in the sample dotenv files.

1. Copy `dotenv.sample.txt` to `.env` and updated it to point to the appropriate API urls.
2. Install the dependencies with: `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to launch the project.
