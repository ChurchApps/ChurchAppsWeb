      <p>Churches have many different technical needs that require different solutions; some custom, some not. We have focussed on the top 3 technology needs of churches and built platforms to help meet those effectively; getting online, live streaming, and church management. Although these are the most common technical needs, they are not the only technical needs that churches face. Weâ€™re here to help no matter what your needs are. Best of all, all of our services are provided 100% free of charge to churches and ministries.</p>
